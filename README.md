## Description
Project Malpka is a Discord Bot made using Node.js enviroment.
The most important function of the bot is selecting a random game from Steam, which I won't play.
Solution uses MySQL database made by me instead of a simple JSON file (official Steam API) to reduce the load imposed on the bot.

### Technologies


I don't like playing computer games. It's immature.
