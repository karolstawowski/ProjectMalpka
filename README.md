# ProjectMalpka
Project Malpka is a Discord Bot made using Node.js.
The most important function of the bot is selecting a random game, using Steam API, which I won't play.
Also uses MySQL database instead of simple JSON file to reduce the load imposed on the bot.

I don't like playing computer games. It's immature.
